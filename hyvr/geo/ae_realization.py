    """
    AE realizations are the realization of a certain AE type in a HyVR
    simulation. For example, in the 'made.ini' test case, the lowest stratum
    consists of 'clay_sheet' architectural elements. While 'clay_sheet' is an AE
    type, each of these sheets is an AE realization.

    This is the base class for AE realizations. Any instantiated object should
    be an instance of one of the (currently) three subtypes: ``TroughAE``,
    ``ChannelAE``, and ``SheetAE``.

    Typically these objects should not be created directly, but via the
    ``generate_realization`` method of the respective ``AEType`` object.

    An AE realization contains a list of geometrical objects that are typical
    for this AE. For example, a TroughAE contains a list of Trough objects.
    These objects should be implemented in separate files as cython cdef
    classes, similar to the Trough class.

    AERealizations are designed to be used from Python and from Cython code.
    Therefore, after construction the object list is converted to multiple
    arrays of object properties.

    For example, a TroughAE has a list of Trough objects, and each Trough object
    has a property ``a`` of type float (lenth of semi-major axis of ellipsoid).
    Therefore, the TroughAE object also has a float array called ``object_a`` as
    property.
    This makes access from Cyton code faster, because we can then iterate over
    float arrays, instead of iterating over Python lists.
    
    The derived AERealization types must provide the methods
    ``generate_object``, ``maybe_assign_points_to_objects`` and
    ``maybe_assign_points_to_object``.
